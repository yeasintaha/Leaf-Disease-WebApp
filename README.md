**Leaf Disease Classification**

This project aims to develop a leaf disease classification system that can be used to detect leaf diseases through live voice command, text, or voice MP3 file upload. The system is designed to be easy to use and accessible to everyone, including farmers and growers who may not have access to traditional agricultural diagnostic tools.

**System Overview**

_The system consists of three main components:_
    `A voice recognition module`: This module converts the user's voice command or MP3 file into text.
    `A text processing module`: This module preprocesses the text input to prepare it for the classification model.
    `Leaf disease classification model`: This model is trained on a large dataset of leaf images and disease labels. The model takes the preprocessed text input as input and outputs a prediction of the leaf disease.

**Demonstration**
